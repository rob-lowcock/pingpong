# Ping Pong

Our team uses ping pong as a useful break from pair programming, and this normally means we play doubles. This project is designed to keep track of our games and give us an idea of how we're all doing.

It's very much a work in progress. If you want something for tracking one-on-one matches, [racquet.io](http://racquet.io) is a very good bet.
